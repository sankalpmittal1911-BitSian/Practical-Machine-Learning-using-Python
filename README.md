# Practical-Machine-Learning-using-Python
Below repository lists all basic ML algorithms in python. You can suggest me to add some algorithms if missing.

For basic algorithms, we resort to sklearn library. Although you should also try to code from scratch. Remember y = np.dot(w.T,X) the basic linear hypothesis ? Try running loop to train manually. Never forget basics!

Good luck!
